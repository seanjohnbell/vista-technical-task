# Vista Higher Learning Technical Task

## To Start The Project

In the project directory, you can run `npm i` to install the packages required to run the project, followed by `npm start` which will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default browser.

## Project Approach

To start this coding test I worked with the CRA (Create React App) framework to build a quick app with React. I also included the Typescript variant for better code maintainability and to safeguard against some of the more chaotic javascript behaviours.

I also installed SASS to allow for cleaner CSS creation, with helper functions for common styles.

I used the React-Icons library to use clean SVG icons for the recording controls.

The app has responsive design elements, switching alignment of elements when the page width descreases below 350px.

## Project Critique

Were I to do this project again, I would likely work with a design library for more unified design language (eg, material design, ant-d, bootstrap etc), but I chose not to do this for my version of this as I wanted to show that I could work with raw html/css as opposed to pulling in completed components from a library.
